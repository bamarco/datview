  be added via register-representation.

  Note: State is currently in a var in dat.view.representation; There will maybe eventually be a default such, but it
  would be good to make it possible to not do that."

  be added via register-representation.

;; You can either use these components standalone, by creating your app instance with `(new-datview ...)`, and starting it with the `start` function (both defined below).
;; Convention is to call datview instances either app or datview.
;; But you should be thinking about them as the application object of your program.

;; Should make this derefable
